# Robotino Line Follower with Obstacle Avoidance

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Robotino robot capable of following a line and avoiding obstacles in real-time. The robot uses sensor inputs to navigate efficiently, detect obstacles, and adjust its path to avoid collisions while returning to the predefined line.

## Features
1. **Line Following**: 
   - The robot tracks a predefined line on the ground.
   - High-speed operation is supported but with reduced precision.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - Detects obstacles using proximity sensors.
   - Adjusts its trajectory dynamically to bypass obstacles.

3. **Collision Detection**:
   - Stops the robot upon physical impact, using bumpers or other sensors.

4. **Recovery Logic**:
   - Ensures the robot returns to the path after avoiding obstacles.

## Implementation Milestones
- **Milestone 1**: Basic line-following functionality implemented.
- **Milestone 2**: Obstacle detection and avoidance logic added.
- **Milestone 3**: Collision detection with stopping behavior.
- **Milestone 4**: Improved obstacle avoidance with smoother turns.
- **Milestone 5**: Manual control functionality added.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Lua
- **Hardware**: Robotino
